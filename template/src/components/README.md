# Atomic Design

This project leverages the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology to create a scalable and easy to maintain component folder structure.

> In short, Atomic Design is a methodology proposed by [**@bradfrost**](https://github.com/bradfrost) by which you can better organize your UI components. It can be done by separating components in `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, `pages` and `templates`.

However, these are not rules you must follow to the letter. Just take them as a basis for your project and adapt it for what better fits your use case.
